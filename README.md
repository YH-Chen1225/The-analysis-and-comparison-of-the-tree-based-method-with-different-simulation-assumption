# The-analysis-and-comparison-of-the-tree-based-method-with-different-simulation-assumption
The replication and expansion of the paper Utami, I. T. , Sartono, B. , &amp; Sadik, K. (2014). Comparison of Single and Ensemble Classifiers of Support Vector Machine and Classification Tree. Journal of Mathematical  Sciences and Applications, 2(2), 17-20.

## The first part of this project 
- `Decision Tree`, `Bagging Method`, `Random Forest`, `Boosting Method` and `Adaboost` would be introduce, and their math properties and derivation would be explained. 
- Also, the clear example of calculation process would be included.

## The second part of this project
Three data-generating process which follow the paper mentioned above would be applied to test the performance of these algorithms
1. First Data generating process is `perfect linearly` separable dataset
2. Second Data generating process is `non-perfect linearly` separable dataset
3. Third Data generating process is `non-linear` separable dataset

For each data generating process:
- Once simulation with 50000 observations would be conducted
- 1000 Times simulation with 1200 observations would be conducted
- ROC curve and Confusion matrix for each algorithm would be provided
- Average misclassification rate for each algorithm would be provided and compared
